                    </span>
                    <h6> The sneaker resale market has grown exponentially over the years, with an estimated value of $6
                        billion dollars by 2025. One of the major marketplaces, StockX, works with a bid-ask system,
                        where buyers place bids on the model and size they want, while sellers can fulfill these bids or
                        place an ask of a price they are looking for.
                    </h6>
                    <h6> With such a booming market, many people are now looking towards sneakers as an investment, and
                        like any other investment, whether it be stocks, art, or real estate, there are many nuances one
                        must be aware of when deciding which pairs to buy and hold. Some models, like the <a
                            href='https://stockx.com/air-jordan-1-mid-chicago-toe'>Air Jordan 1 Mid 'Chicago Black
                            Toe'</a> and the <a href='https://stockx.com/jordan-1-retro-chicago-2015'>Air Jordan 1 High
                            'Chicago'</a> look extremely similar to the untrained eye, but fetch magnitudes of different
                        prices. Furthermore, not every model appreciates in value at the same pace, or may not
                        appreciate at all, and stay flat or even depreciate. In order to show general trends, I
                        collected 16 pairs of sneakers that could be used as a starting point in understand what sells
                        and what doesn't.

                        Split into four categories for the four major brands (Jordan Brand, Nike, Yeezy, adidas), each
                        model has a different trajectory that can be replicated with other models. Note that Jordan
                        Brand is a part of Nike, and Yeezy is a part of adidas, but both have grown to such high levels
                        that many people consider them separate entities when discussing sneakers.

                                    <h6> The most classic Jordan of all time, this model in this colorway was Jordan's
                                        first signature shoe. It originally debuted in 1985 during Jordan's rookie
                                        season, and has returned in this form three times since then: in 1994, 2013, and
                                        2015. Clearly, the 2015 iteration has been in very high demand since its
                                        release, with prices never dipping much below $500. However, with the
                                        announcement of The Last Dance, a docuseries on Michael
                                        Jordan's career, the price on these skyrocketed, and can now fetch abouve
                                        $2,000. There are rumors of a 2021 restock however, so
                                        the price on this iteartion may change once that date passes.

                                    <h6> Yet another classic Jordan model. this colorway was originally released in
                                        1989. Since then, this colorway has returned
                                        twice, in 1999 and in 2012. However, the 2012 model was not very true to the
                                        original, with a Jumpman logo on the heel of the shoe rather than a Nike Air
                                        logo. When the 2020 restock was announced, it marked the first time in over 20
                                        years since a true-to-the-original version of the Bred (Black Red) Jordan 4 had
                                        released. Stock numbers were incredibly high, and early on the pair hardly sold
                                        for over retail price. However, as time goes on the price has gone up
                                        significantly, and can now fetch over 400 dollars.

                                    <h6> This colorway of the Jordan 11 is nicknamed 'Concord' for the hits of purple on
                                        the sole, similar in color to Concord grapes. When the shoe was originally
                                        released in 1995, its nontraditional look and materials completely changed the
                                        sneaker game. This model has returned in various forms, including in a low-top
                                        form and even in cleat form, many times. This 2018 restock was rumored to be
                                        over 1 million pairs. However, demand was extremely high and though prices have
                                        stayed flat for the first year or so of its release, recently the price has been
                                        climbing quickly, in part thanks to The Last Dance docuseries.

                                    <h6> Interestingly, Jordan 1 Mids were considered a sub-par shoe since its release.
                                        They were the 'wanna-be' Jordan 1s, and often sat on sale on outlet shelves.
                                        However, in 2020, Jordan Brand started pumping out actual desirable
                                        colorways, such as this Light Smoke Grey pair, and the publics' outlook on Mids
                                        have slowly started to change. This colorway released right after the Dior
                                        Jordan 1s, a retail $2,200 price luxury collaboration released, and the colors
                                        are nearly identical, which may explain the unusally high price for a pair of
                                        Mids. If the public opinion changes even more favorable towards Mids, the price
                                        on this pair may climb even higher.

                                        landmark 'The Ten' collaboration,
                                        this model was an instant hit and sold out immediately on release. Though other
                                        pairs, like the Off-White Jordan 1 and Off-White Air Force 1 fetch even higher
                                        prices, the Blazer Mid has kept up in price over the years. Since then,
                                        Off-White has grown into an even larger brand, and Virgil Abloh was appointed to
                                        the head of Louis Vuitton, which may explain the consistent rise in value of
                                        this pair.

                                        fairly high prices, around $300, but none of the later colorways produced by
                                        Nike had the same success, with most pairs eventually going on sale. When a
                                        restock of this pair was announced, the price instantly dropped, and has not
                                        recovered since. The restocked pairs eventually went on sale, and the average
                                        resale price of this pair has dropped to sub $100 levels, a shocking price for a
                                        $160 retail shoe that resold for over $300 less than a year ago.

                                        $600 at release. Later on, rumors started circulating that Sean
                                        Wotherspoon and Nike had split up. Prices started to climb, and eventually when
                                        Sean
                                        officially announced so on social media, the price skyrocketed to where it is

                                        pair has had.

                                        Concepts, this was the fifth pair in the 'Lobster' collection between the two.
                                        Though its initial prices were fairly high, when Travis Scott wore this pair on
                                        his Instagram, the prices shot up to where it is today. 2019/20 has seen a Nike
                                        Dunk renaissance led by Travis, with old pairs that sold for sub retail prices
                                        just a few years ago shot up in value. Currently the Dunk market has inflated to
                                        a crazy level, with old models such as the Newcastles, which released in 2008,
                                        fetching prices of +$1000 even though just a few years ago they were a hard sell
                                        at $80.

                                        refused to give Kanye the creative freedom that he wanted. Eventually, he left
                                        Nike to join adidas, who promised him infinite freedom to design as he wanted.
                                        The first adidas x Kanye shoe were these, the Yeezy Boost 350s. With low stock
                                        and an A-tier name behind it, the shoe sold out instantly and fetched prices of

                                        has not sold out after days, and resale prices are extremely low, with some

                                        Its initial release saw prices of over $500, but eventually a massive restock,
                                        where adidas took infnite orders for a duration of time as a made-to-order
                                        sneaker, caused the price to come crashing down. However, demand for the model
                                        clearly remains very high, and despite the 'infnite' restock prices have climbed
                                        to over double retail, with some sizes fetching three or four times retail
                                        price.

                                    <h6> This sneaker was part of adidas' original 'Consortium' collection, where adidas
                                        teamed up with various boutiques to produce colorways of the still fresh Ultra
                                        Boost. This model, a collaboration with SneakersNStuff, was one of the most
                                        popular at the time, with prices reaching over $2,000. However, since adidas'
                                        golden years of 2015-2017, the hype for Ultra Boosts have died completely, and
                                        every model has come down in price greatly. Even the Tee Times, the most
                                        popular, currently go for less than a third of its peak prices.

                                    <h6> One of the original colorways of the Ultra Boost debuting in 2015, the Burgundy
                                        colorway, alongside the Olive colorway, were extremely limited and were worth
                                        over $2,000 at one point, despite it being a general colorway and not a
                                        collaboration. However, similar to the Tee Times, the waning popularity of the
                                        Ultra Boost has brought its price down considerably, and a restock of this
                                        colorway in 2020 completely killed resale, and are still available at retailers
                                        for half off. Once one of the most hyped Ultra Boost colorways of all time, now
                                        this colorway sits on discount store racks.

                                    <h6> Part of Pharell Williams' second collaboration with adidas. With the initial
                                        collaboration pairs going for over $2,000, the sneakers in the second pack
                                        fetched high prices initially, wt around $400. However, since then Pharell and
                                        adidas has released unpopular colorway after colorway, and this alongside the
                                        general declining hype for adidas sneakers have killed the resale market on all
                                        Pharell shoes, now going for just below retail. It seems as if
                                        adidas has realised its mistake of releasing so many undesirable colorways in a
                                        row, as they are now producing more basic wearable colors. However, the public
                                        has long since moved on from this model, and even those colorways have sat on
                                        shelves.

                                    <h6> adidas, boutique Undefeated, and streetwear brand Bape are long time
                                        collaborators, having produced many shoes and apparel designs over the years.
                                        The latest model, the adidas ZX 8000, was released in late 2020 to little
                                        attention. Though once anything that Bape and adidas touched would have flown
                                        off shelves, the waning public interest in both brands have killed the resale
                                        market on these tremendously. Though a fairly wearble colorway compared to some
                                        other adidas x Bape x Undefeated models, the hype for adidas is just not there
                                        anymore. Eventually, these did sell out though, which is more than what can be
                                        said for recent Pharell adidas collaborations.
